# The script must take in input as an argument the directory where the 
# database is stored.
# for example:
#   ./pokemoninfo.sh dataset/
# note that the name 'dataset' should not be hardcoded. It can be any directory
# name. Make sure to read slides 33,34,39 
# Store the folder name in a variable called DBDIR.
DBDIR=$1

# use this function to show an error message with usage information.
errormsg() {
   echo "Usage:"
   echo "$0 <directory>"
   echo "directory must be a path containing a csv dataset."	
}

### Exercise 1: 1 points
# Write an error and exit if no command line argument exists or if the argument
# is empty (it could be a variable!)
# hint: use the if construct and the proper conditions to verify the arguments

# Error if no argument is entered. Exercise 2 accounts for if the input is not a directory
if [[ $# -le 0 ]] ; then
echo "No argument, please input the directory database"
exit 1
fi

### Exercise 2: 1 points
# Write an error and exit if the DBDIR directory does not exist or it's not a directory.
# Hint: read http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_07_01.html

# Testing whether DBDIR is a directory
if [ -d $DBDIR ]
then echo "Thank you, this is a directory"
# Exit if it is not a directory
else echo "This does not exist, or is not a directory"
exit 1
fi



### Exercise 3: 1 point
# Use the grep command to find which file contains "Pokémon Red Version"
# and output the results on screen.
# grep examples: http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_04_02.html

echo -e "\nsearching for Pokémon Red..."

#Appropriate grep command for find file with this line
grep -r -H "Pokémon Red Version" $DBDIR

### Exercise 4: 1 point
# delete existing allplatform.csv file in preparation of the next exercise
echo -e "\nRemoving old allplatforms.csv"

#Easier to remove allplatforms.csv.ordered as well for debugging
rm $DBDIR/allplatforms.csv
rm $DBDIR/allplatforms.ordered.csv

### Exercise 5: 3 points
# Write a for loop that takes every file in the database and puts it 
# into a single file
# called allplatforms.csv.
# Inspect the csv files to understand their structure,
# and make sure to remove the header lines.
# Hint: use the slides about for ... do ... done
#       use the tail command to remove the header lines (check 'man tail'),
#       use the file concatenator '>>' to write out the allplatforms.csv file

# create allplatforms file with a for loop
echo -e "\nCreating new allplatforms.csv"

# For loop to cycle through every file in DBDIR

for f in $DBDIR/*; do

# Tail command to miss header line in each file, then write this to new file

tail -n +2 $f >> $DBDIR/allplatforms.csv;
done


### Exercise 4: 1 point
# Sort the contents of the allplatforms.csv file by using the sort 
# command and write the result in allplatforms.ordered.csv
# Hint: use \" as a delimiter for sort. Check 'man sort'
echo -e "\nSorting allplatforms.csv..."

#contents sorted alphanumerically

sort -d $DBDIR/allplatforms.csv > $DBDIR/allplatforms.ordered.csv 



# Exercise 5: 4 points
# Write a for loop that, for each file, counts all the games
# in each file. Inspect the csv file to understand the structure of the 
# csv file to get the right numbers.
# Hint: use the slides about for ... do ... done
#       use the '$()' syntax to put the output of a command inside a variable
#       use the program tail to get rid of useless lines
#       use the program wc to count things
#       make use of the | symbol to compose         
#       use the 'basename' command to get rid of the directory part of the filename
# output the result in this form:
# <filename> has <number of games> games <newline>
# example output:
# poke.Android.csv has 2 game(s)
# poke.iOS.csv has 1 game(s)
echo -e "\nCalculating number of games for each file..."

# Again, for loop to cycle through each file in DBDIR

for files in $DBDIR/*; do

# Function to remove directory part of filename

fbname=$(basename "$files" .csv)

# Function to again remove headers, and count new lines (games) in each file

lines=$(tail -n +2 $files | wc -l) 

# Final output using above two functions

echo "$fbname has $lines games"

# I am aware that there is an error here
# as the top lines of the allplatforms files
# will also be deleted. I was unsure of how to
# correct for this



done

exit 0;
